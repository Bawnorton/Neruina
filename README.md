# Neruina

### This is a mod that prevents ticking entity and ticking block entity / tile entity crashes from bricking worlds.

## When an Entity causes a ticking crash:
- #### Entities will be immediately killed, dropping any inventory they have.
- #### Block Entities / Tile Entities will no longer tick, you can still access the block inventory if it has one.
- #### If another mod causes the player to crash on tick, the player will be kicked instead.
