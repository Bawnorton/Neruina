## When an Entity causes a ticking crash:
- #### That Entity will be immediately killed, dropping any inventory they have.
- #### That Block Entity / Tile Entity will no longer tick, you can still access the block inventory if it has one.
- #### If another mod causes the Player to crash on tick, the Player will be kicked instead.
